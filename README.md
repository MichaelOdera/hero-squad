## Installation
It is imperative that you install a JavaRuntimeEnvironment IDEA and Gradle dependencies else the system won't funtion as required. Knwoledge 
of HTML5 and CSS3 is also mandatory. Knowledge of working with Java is also important.

## Description
The project above, allows someone to enter any hero's details, and the the choice of the squad to which the hero will belong to. The date is also important since it will show when a hero was created though it is not entered by a user. The user can then oberve the name of the heros and various squads. From the details of the powers or weakness of a hero the ratings of a squad and the hero can then be calculated.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.



## Live Link
This is the livelink to my website https://mikes-hero-squad.herokuapp.com/

Run `gradle run` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4567/`. The app will not automatically change if you make any changes white the app is still live. A rerun of the command will b needed in this case.

## Code scaffolding

Run `netstat -pliten |grep java` to check for ports that are being used by java processes. You can also use `gradle run|build`.

## Build

Run `gradle build` to build the project. The `build.gradle` file is impotrant for any of the required process dependencies to function properly.

## Running unit tests

Run `run test` to execute the unit tests on your local directory after git cloning or downloading.
